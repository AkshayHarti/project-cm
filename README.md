# Project CM

Project CM is an open-source collaboration project from mentors and coders in the [Code Mentoring](https://www.meetup.com/Melbourne-Code-Mentoring-Web-Development-Design/) community.

It's an innovation by the community at large for the sole purpose of learning. As such, anybody who is part of the community is welcome to join, learn and submit ideas.


## Contributing and getting a "role"
Roles for Project CM are very informal guidelines for "who is working on what". That said, there are a few project maintainers who are more active with the project, and generally shape the roadmap/direction.

You can assign yourself a role by following the instructions in the [ROLES.md](ROLES.md) document.
